# Scheduling Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Class Scheduling
1. **Add, Edit, and Delete Class Schedules**:
   - Administrators can add new classes, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed.
   - Each class entry should include:
     - Subject name
     - Instructor
     - Room
     - Time slot (start time, end time)
     - Recurrence (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly)

2. **Assign Instructors, Rooms, and Time Slots**:
   - Assign instructors to each class.
   - Assign rooms based on availability and capacity.
   - Select time slots ensuring no conflicts.

3. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Ensure no overlapping classes for instructors and rooms.
   - Provide real-time feedback if a conflict is detected.

4. **Constraints Management**:
   - Define and enforce constraints such as:
     - Room capacity
     - Instructor availability
     - Course prerequisites
     - Preferred time slots for certain courses

### Exam Scheduling
1. **Add, Edit, and Delete Exam Schedules**:
   - Administrators can add new exams, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed.
   - Each exam entry should include:
     - Course name
     - Room
     - Time slot (date, start time, end time)
     - Invigilators

2. **Assign Rooms, Time Slots, and Invigilators**:
   - Assign rooms based on availability and capacity.
   - Select time slots ensuring no conflicts with other exams or classes.
   - Assign invigilators to each exam.

3. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Ensure no overlapping exams for students, rooms, and invigilators.
   - Provide real-time feedback if a conflict is detected.

4. **Constraints Management**:
   - Define and enforce constraints such as:
     - Room capacity
     - Invigilator availability
     - Exam duration
     - Preferred time slots for certain exams

### Automatic Schedule Generation
1. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - The algorithm should process the entered data and generate a schedule that meets all constraints.
   - Algorithms to consider:
     - Genetic Algorithm
     - Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
     - Graph Coloring Algorithm

2. **Manual Adjustments**:
   - Allow administrators to manually adjust automatically generated schedules.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for making adjustments.

3. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Provide real-time feedback during manual adjustments to ensure constraints are not violated.

### User Interface
1. **Data Entry Forms**:
   - Provide user-friendly forms for entering subjects, rooms, time slots, and teacher availability.
   - Include validation to ensure data integrity (e.g., no duplicate entries, valid time formats).

2. **Schedule Generation**:
   - Provide a button or option to run the scheduling algorithm once all data is entered.
   - Display a progress indicator while the algorithm is processing.

3. **Schedule Display**:
   - Show the generated schedule in a calendar view.
   - Highlight any conflicts or issues detected by the algorithm.

4. **Manual Adjustments**:
   - Allow administrators to manually adjust the generated schedule.
   - Provide real-time feedback to ensure adjustments do not violate constraints.

5. **Save and Export**:
   - Save the final schedule to the database.
   - Provide options to export the schedule to various formats (e.g., PDF, Excel).

### Notifications
1. **Schedule Updates**:
   - Notify teachers and students of any changes to their schedules via email and in-app notifications.
   - Allow users to set preferences for notification types.

2. **Upcoming Classes and Exams**:
   - Remind users of upcoming classes and exams.
   - Allow users to customize reminder settings (e.g., how far in advance to receive reminders).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. **Scalability**:
   - Ensure the scheduling system can handle an increasing number of users and schedules without performance degradation.

2. **Response Time**:
   - Ensure the system responds to user actions within acceptable time limits, especially during scheduling operations.

### Security
1. **Data Security**:
   - Ensure that schedule data is securely stored and transmitted.
   - Implement access controls to restrict schedule modifications to authorized users.

### Usability
1. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Ensure the scheduling interface is intuitive and easy to use for administrators and instructors.
   - Provide detailed help and documentation.

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the scheduling interface is accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

## Example Use Case

1. **Administrator Adds New Data**:
   - The administrator logs in and navigates to the data management section.
   - They add new subjects, rooms, time slots, and teacher availability.
   - They ensure all required data is entered and validated.

2. **Running the Scheduling Algorithm**:
   - The administrator navigates to the scheduling section and clicks the "Generate Schedule" button.
   - The algorithm processes the data and generates an optimal schedule.
   - The administrator reviews the schedule, makes any necessary manual adjustments, and saves the final version.

3. **Teachers and Students View Schedules**:
   - Teachers and students log in to their dashboards to view their schedules.
   - They receive notifications of any changes or upcoming events.

## Additional Considerations

### Integration
1. **Existing Systems**:
   - Integrate with existing college systems (e.g., student information system, room booking system).
   - Ensure seamless data flow between systems.

### Customization
2. **Flexible Scheduling Options**:
   - Allow customization of scheduling parameters (e.g., time slots, room capacities).
   - Enable users to set personal preferences for viewing schedules and receiving notifications.
