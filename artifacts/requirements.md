# Class Scheduling and Exam Scheduling Application Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### User Management
1. **User Roles**:
   - Define roles: Administrator, Instructor, Student, and Scheduler.
   - Each role has specific permissions and access levels.

2. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secure login/logout functionality.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain features.

### Scheduling Features
3. **Class Scheduling**:
   - Add, edit, and delete class schedules.
   - Assign instructors, rooms, and time slots to classes.
   - Ensure no time conflicts for instructors and rooms.

4. **Exam Scheduling**:
   - Add, edit, and delete exam schedules.
   - Assign rooms, time slots, and invigilators for exams.
   - Ensure no conflicts for students, rooms, and invigilators.

5. **Constraint Management**:
   - Define constraints (e.g., room capacity, instructor availability, course prerequisites).
   - Validate schedules against these constraints.

6. **Automatic Schedule Generation**:
   - Use algorithms to generate optimal schedules automatically.
   - Allow manual adjustments post-generation.

### Notification and Communication
7. **Notifications**:
   - Notify users of schedule changes via email and in-app notifications.
   - Remind users of upcoming classes and exams.

8. **Communication**:
   - Provide a messaging system for users to communicate about scheduling issues.

### Reporting and Analytics
9. **Reports**:
   - Generate reports on class and exam schedules.
   - Export schedules to various formats (PDF, Excel).

10. **Analytics**:
    - Provide insights into room utilization, instructor workloads, and student schedules.

### User Interface
11. **Dashboard**:
    - Personalized dashboards for each user role.
    - Display upcoming classes, exams, and notifications.

12. **Calendar View**:
    - Provide a calendar view of schedules.
    - Allow users to filter by course, instructor, room, etc.

### Data Management
13. **Data Import/Export**:
    - Import data from existing systems.
    - Export data for backup and integration with other systems.

14. **Database Management**:
    - Regular database backups.
    - Data archiving for historical schedules.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. **Scalability**:
   - Handle increasing numbers of users and schedules.
   - Ensure performance does not degrade with scale.

2. **Response Time**:
   - Ensure the system responds to user actions within acceptable time limits.

### Security
3. **Data Security**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

4. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Regular automated backups.
   - Disaster recovery plan to restore service in case of failure.

### Usability
5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
   - Provide help and documentation for users.

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

### Maintainability
7. **Code Quality**:
   - Adhere to coding standards and best practices.
   - Write modular, well-documented code.

8. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, system).
   - Automated tests for critical functionalities.

### Compatibility
9. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Ensure the application works across different web browsers and devices.
   - Support for mobile and tablet devices.

## Additional Considerations

### Integration
1. **Third-Party Integrations**:
   - Integrate with existing college systems (e.g., student information system, email servers).
   - API support for future integrations.

### Customization
2. **Customizable Settings**:
   - Allow customization of time slots, room capacities, and other parameters.
   - Enable users to set personal preferences for notifications and views.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Administrator Adds a New Class**:
   - The administrator logs in and navigates to the class management section.
   - They enter the class details, assign an instructor, and select available rooms and time slots.
   - The system checks for conflicts and saves the schedule if none are found.

2. **Instructor Views Their Schedule**:
   - The instructor logs in and sees their personalized dashboard.
   - They can view their class and exam schedules, and receive notifications of any changes.

3. **Student Receives Exam Reminder**:
   - The student logs in and checks their dashboard.
   - They receive a reminder for an upcoming exam via email and in-app notification.

4. **Automatic Schedule Generation**:
   - The scheduler sets up constraints and runs the scheduling algorithm.
   - The system generates an optimal schedule, which can be reviewed and adjusted manually.
